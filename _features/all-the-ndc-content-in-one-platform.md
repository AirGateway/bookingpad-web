NDC doesn't mean de-aggregated distribution nor one screen or shopping GUI for each airline group. We have integrated all the NDC content in one platform and desktop to facilitate aggregated shopping with comparison, booking, and servicing of all the content with the same workflow. We specifically support a number of key features for managed travel:

* Shopping for **published, private, negotiated, tour-operator, and corporate fares.**
* Pre and Post-booking **seats and ancillary services addition**.
* **Order cancellations**, including expiration, voids, and refunds.
* **Itinerary and dates changes**
* **Cabin/class Upgrades or downgrades**
