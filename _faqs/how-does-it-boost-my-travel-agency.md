NDC was created by IATA to disrupt existing airline distribution technology (mostly GDS-based) bringing new ways to shop, book, and service airline content. Using Bookingpad agencies can **increase their value-added service and revenue** in multiple ways:

1. **Avoid the so-called GDS surcharges.** It's well-known that a growing number of airlines have introduced channel-oriented surcharges in order to disincentivize the GDS.

2. **Move your business into a modern web-based/cloud-based stack.** It brings a lot of logistic advantages that all your agency team has access to a web-based tool anytime with the only requirement of a Google Chrome that can even be accessed from a mobile phone.

3. **Reduce fixed, operational, and training costs/times.** The GDS solutions are not cheap. If you measure the amount of learning curve, licenses, and operational costs that a GDS solution requires in the long run, their cost for the agency is very high. Join our Next-Gen distribution technology tool, which takes advantage of all the innovation that the WEB has brought to other industries.
