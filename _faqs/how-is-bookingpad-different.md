title: How is Bookingpad different to the so called airline Agency Portals?
short: "Short story: Multi-airline Vs. Single airline. This applied to shopping,
  booking, servicing and down-stream process."

There are existing solutions for direct distribution commonly called "Agency Portals" provided by airline groups (normally for free) such as:

* [IAG Agency Portal](https://agencyportal.iag.cloud/login)
* [Lufthansa Group SPRK](https://dcwebc.farelogix.com/sprk-lhg/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fsprk-lhg)
* [AF/KL Agent Connect](https://www.agentconnect.biz/FR/fr/local/process/prehome/choose_country.wadis)
* [AA SPRK](https://dcwebc.farelogix.com/sprk-aa/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fsprk-aa%2f)

These solutions work only for an airline group. This might be a big problem for agencies, who can reasonably argue that they don't provide a functional way to operate in a multi-airline environment as they have been traditionally doing in the legacy systems like GDSs.

After your agency gets authorized by each earline’s NDC, Bookingpad will aggregate **all of their content**, for shopping, booking, and servicing **in one single and consistent web** GUI. This means that your agents won’t have to learn a different user experience to work with each airline.

Although it seems the opposite, having all the content aggregated in one place is the exact purpose of NDC as a distribution standard, not quite the contradictory argument for which NDC might have been created with the purpose of obfuscating fares comparison.
