I"A<p>With the purpose of facilitating browsing the large amount of NDC offers provided by airlines on certain routes we have implemented a way o visualising all grouped by equal itineraries showing different cabin and fare combinations as options.</p>

<p>The agent can activate this option by checking the Group Itineraries check when shopping NDC results.</p>

<p>Once activated NDC offers will appear like this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/uploads/Bookingpad-upgrade_options-group-itinearies_.png" alt="Bookingpad Group Itineraries feature (Upgrade Options)" title="Bookingpad Group Itineraries feature (Upgrade Options)" /></p>

<p>This feature facilitates the visualisation of the entire cabins/fares catalogue at one sight, and the possibility of offering good upgrade deals to the customer, which well-known to be one of the main objetives of NDC as a new distribution strategy itself.</p>
