title: How is Bookingpad different to the so called airline Agency Portals?

There are existing solutions for direct distribution commonly called "Agency Portals" provided by airline groups (normally for free) such as:

* [IAG Agency Portal](https://agencyportal.iag.cloud/login)
* [Lufthansa Group SPRK](https://dcwebc.farelogix.com/sprk-lhg/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fsprk-lhg)
* [AF/KL Agent Connect](https://www.agentconnect.biz/FR/fr/local/process/prehome/choose_country.wadis)
* [AA SPRK](https://dcwebc.farelogix.com/sprk-aa/User/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fsprk-aa%2f)

The big problem of these solutions is that they work only for an airline group, which agencies reasonably argue that is not a reasonable way to work in a multi-airline environment as they have been traditionally doing in the legacy systems like GDSs.

Bookingpad aggregates content, for shopping, booking, and servicing for **ALL the NDC airlines you have been authorized**. All of it in one single and consistent web GUI, which means that your agents don't need to learn a different user experience for working with each airline.

This, BTW, is precisely the purpose of NDC itself as a distribution standard, in opposition to the argumentation that NDC has been created to obfuscate fares comparison.
