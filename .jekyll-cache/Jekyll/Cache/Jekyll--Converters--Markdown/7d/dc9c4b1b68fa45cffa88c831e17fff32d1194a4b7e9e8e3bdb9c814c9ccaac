I"r<p>Today it has been rolled out our most relevant product upgrade since the launch of Bookingpad, the ability to perform date changes on already issued orders.</p>

<p>To use this feature agent needs to scroll down to the bottom buttons of an existing order and click on “Change Itinerary” button.</p>

<p>Once this is triggered, agent gets a re-shop modal window to select new date(s) for each of the trips.</p>
