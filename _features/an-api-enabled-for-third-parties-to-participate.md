Bookingpad is an open platform that enables third-party players to interact with it. Our extremely simple API allows third-parties to access a number of functionalities on behalf of the agencies upon proper authorization:

* Shop, Book, and service their content
* Access their Orders for exporting purposes (Mid/Backoffice Systems)
* Access with read/write permission their Corporates and Traveler profiles on our platform
* We can actively send outgoing Webhooks (HTTP notices) to third-parties based on a number of events happening in our platform (Order issuing, changes, cancellation, or even service disruption events such a schedule change)

You can find descriptive APIs documentation [in our Developer's Guide](https://dev-guides.airgateway.net/).
